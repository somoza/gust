## Motivation
As a CTO and founder, I was tired of spending buckets of money to set up and manage [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/), dealing with multiple databases, countless processes, Docker complexity, and of course its outdated and buggy UI. So we decided to build something that kept what we liked about Airflow and ditched what we didn’t. The result is Gust: a platform that’s 10× more efficient, faster, and far easier to set up.

Gust is the perfect fit for our needs, and I encourage you to try it and push it even further. There’s still plenty of room for improvements and new features. If you spot something or want to contribute an idea, don’t be shy! Drop an Issue or submit a PR.

## Overview

### DAG Code Example
```elixir
defmodule HelloWorld do
  # `schedule` and `on_finished_callback` are optional.
  # You can use special expressions provided by the quantum package, ex: @daily, @hourly, and etc..
  # https://hexdocs.pm/quantum/crontab-format.html
  use Gust.DSL, schedule: "* * * * *", on_finished_callback: :notify_something

  # Gust logs are stored and displayed through GustWeb via Logger.
  require Logger

  # Gust.Flows is used to query Dag, Run, and Task.
  alias Gust.Flows

  # Defining a callback for when run is done.
  def notify_something(status, run) do
    dag = Flows.get_dag!(run.dag_id)
    message = "DAG: #{dag.name}; completed with status: #{status}"
    Logger.info(message)
  end

  # Declaring "first_task" task; setting a downstream task and telling Gust to store its result.
  task :first_task, downstream: [:second_task], save: true, ctx: %{run_id: run_id} do
    # You can read parameters passed to this run
    run = Flows.get_run!(run_id)
    name = Map.get(run.params, "name", "stranger")

    greetings = "Hi #{name} from first_task"
    Logger.info(greetings)

    # You can get secrets created on the Web UI
    secret = Flows.get_secret_by_name("SUPER_SECRET")
    Logger.warning("I know your secret: #{secret.value}")

    # The return value must be a map when `save` is true.
    %{result: greetings}
  end
  
  # Declaring "second_task" task; using context to fetch another task result.
  task :second_task, ctx: %{run_id: run_id} do

    # Getting "first_task"'s result
    task = Flows.get_task_by_name_run("first_task", run_id)

    Logger.info(task.result)
  end
end

```

## Getting started


*Want to try Gust quickly? Start with the [Docker example](https://github.com/marciok/gust/tree/main/examples/docker). If you want full customization and extension, follow the instructions below to create a Gust app from scratch.*

### Prerequisites

- [x] macOS/Ubuntu
- [x] Elixir must be at least [this version](https://github.com/marciok/gust/blob/main/.tool-versions)
- [x] Postgres


### Creating a new Gust app

1. Replace `my_app` for your app name and run:

```
GUST_APP=my_app bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marciok/gust/main/setup_gust_app.sh)"
```
*You can check what install script will perform [here](https://github.com/marciok/gust/blob/main/setup_gust_app.sh)*

2. Configure Postgres credentials on `my_app/config/dev.exs`

3. Run database setup:
	 - `mix ecto.create`
	 - `mix ecto.migrate`
	 
4. Run Gust start:
	 `mix phx.server`


5. Check [the docs](https://hexdocs.pm/gust/Gust.DSL.html) on how to customize your DAG

6. Open  "http://localhost:4000/gust/dags" to visualize your app

## Features

  - Task orchestration with Cron-style scheduling and dependency-aware DAGs via the Gust DSL.
  - Support multiple nodes.
  - [Support for Python DAGs](https://github.com/marciok/gust/tree/main/apps/gust_py)
  - Manual task controls: stop running tasks, cancel retries, and restart tasks on demand.
  - Run-time tracking, corrupted-state recovery, and graceful handling of syntax errors during development.
  - Retry logic with backoff, plus state clearing for clean restarts.
  - Hook for finished dag run.
  - Web UI for live monitoring, runs and secrets editing.


---
### MCP Server

GustWeb includes a built-in MCP server that gives your LLM access to Gust’s core features, including listing DAGs, triggering runs, exploring DAG definitions, and debugging executions.

To mount it in your Phoenix router:

```elixir
import GustWeb.MCPRouter

scope "/mcp", MyAppWeb do
  pipe_through :api
  gust_mcp_server()
end
```

The prefix comes from your `MyAppWeb` router scope, so you can also mount it
under a project-specific path to avoid clashes:

```elixir
scope "/gust/mcp", MyAppWeb do
  pipe_through :api
  gust_mcp_server()
end
```

That would expose `POST /gust/mcp/server`. Keep auth and any app-specific
policy outside the macro, at the router scope or pipeline level.

### Connect to an MCP client

- claude: `claude mcp add --transport http gust-mcp http://localhost:4000/gust/mcp/server`
- codex: `codex mcp add gust-mcp --url http://localhost:4000/gust/mcp/server`

### Skills

- [Available Skills](https://github.com/marciok/gust/tree/main/skills)

- Install
```
gh skill install marciok/gust elixir-dag-creator
```

## Upgrading from 0.1.29

This note applies only to projects upgrading from Gust `0.1.29` to `0.1.30`
or later.

The project migrated form a simple dependency to an extension of your Phoenix App that is installed via [Igniter](https://hexdocs.pm/igniter/readme.html).  

### Key changes:

Starting with Gust `0.1.30`, `Gust.Repo` stores its migration history in
`gust_schema_migrations` instead of the default `schema_migrations` table.

*Fresh installs do not need any special handling*.

If your project already ran Gust migrations on `0.1.29`, you must bootstrap
the new migration-tracking table before running `mix ecto.migrate`. Otherwise
Ecto will treat all Gust migrations as pending and attempt to run them again.

Run this SQL once against your database before migrating:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS gust_schema_migrations (
  version bigint PRIMARY KEY,
  inserted_at timestamp(0) without time zone
);

```

After that, continue with `mix ecto.migrate` as usual.


---


## Adding Gust to an existing Phoenix app

If you already have a Phoenix project and want to add Gust in place, install `gust_web` with [Igniter](https://hexdocs.pm/igniter).


1. If you do not have Igniter installed yet, bootstrap it first:

```sh
mix local.hex --force
mix archive.install hex igniter_new --force
```

2. From the root of your existing Phoenix project, install `gust_web`:

```sh
mix igniter.install gust_web
```

It will mount the dashboard at `/gust` in your router, and create a `dags/` folder.

3. Review your database config.

Open `dev.exs` and set `Gust.Repo`s credentials

4. Run setup and start the app:

```sh
mix ecto.create
mix ecto.migrate
mix phx.server
```

Open "http://localhost:4000/gust/dags".

---

## Multi-node Setup 

You can run Gust on multiple nodes by passing a role:
-   `core`: Starts only children who are responsible for the pool and executing DAGs
```zsh
GUST_ROLE=core iex --sname core -S mix run --no-halt
```
-   `web`: Starts the server and reads DAG's file children.
```zsh
GUST_ROLE=web iex --sname web -S mix phx.server
```
If you don't pass anything Gust will run as `single` role, that means both `core` and `web` will be enabled.

You can find a full example [here](https://github.com/marciok/gust/tree/main/examples/docker).

## How to Run Tests Locally

1. Start Postgres.
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.test`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.test
   ```
3. Load test environment variables:
   ```bash
   source .env.test
   ```
4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   mix setup
   ```
5. Create and migrate the test database:
   ```bash
   MIX_ENV=test mix ecto.create
   MIX_ENV=test mix ecto.migrate
   ```
6. Run tests:
   ```bash
   mix test
   ```

### Useful Commands

```bash
mix test test/path/to/file_test.exs
mix test --failed
MIX_ENV=test mix coveralls.html --umbrella
```

### Common Failures

- `connection refused`: Postgres is not running or `PGHOST`/`PGUSER`/`PGPASSWORD` are incorrect.
- `database "gust_rc_test" does not exist`: run `MIX_ENV=test mix ecto.create && MIX_ENV=test mix ecto.migrate`.
